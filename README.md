# PythonTools4Neuroimaging
Collection of jupyter notebooks (originally for use with google colab) to aid in practical learning of python tools for neuroimaging research

# Additional resources for fMRI analyses in Python

# Resources for localization (anatomical and functional)
The best way to do this is by referencing primary research articles that delineate your specific region of interest, but you can get started with some online tools
1. Crude (interactive) mapping between MNI152 coordinates and anatomical regions (online)

  - https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/bisweb-manual/tools/mni2tal.html
2. Meta-analytic interactive mapping of MNI coordinates ↔ function ↔ research papers (fMRI)
